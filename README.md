- Use case 1 : from 0 to max value (only positive values)
- Use case 2 : from max value to 0 (only positive values)
- Use case 3 : mix with all possible values (only positive values, including 0, but not starting at 0)
- Use case 4 : mix with all possible values, including negative values (first value is a negative one, and the second is a positive, all others are random values)
